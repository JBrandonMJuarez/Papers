# Analysis of digital signal processing algorithms and their implementation in hardware and embedded software

The present article describes the design and implementation of a finite impulse response (FIR) digital filter on a microcontroller, followed by the utilization of an FPGA to transfer the calculations. 
The performance of this strategy in terms of efficiency and processing capacity is analyzed. The results show that the initial implementation on the microcontroller achieves adequate filter operation, 
but transferring the processing to the FPGA results in a significant improvement in terms of speed and ability to handle complex signals. This combination of devices allows for leveraging the advantages
of each, achieving an efficient and versatile system for real-time digital signal processing.
